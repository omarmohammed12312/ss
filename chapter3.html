        You open the car.<br>  
        You drink from the water bottle that you have.<br>  
        You fill your car tank with the petroleum oil.  <br>
        You go to the jungle by the car. <br>
    </p>
    <p class="begin2">
        You finally reach the jungle.  <br>
        You stop. You find a red car.  <br>
        There is green spray on the red car.<br>  
        Someone sprayed the car writing (HORRORCLAW).<br>  
        You see what's inside the car.  <br>
        You don't find anything.  <br>
        No, wait. There is something in the red car.<br>  
        You find a map in this car.  <br>
        Maybe it is a map for the jungle.<br>
